Codes presented in listings in the dissertation 

This catalog includes codes for methods:
- Neural Network (Python);
- ML-XGBoost example (Python);
The Python codes were done in a functional approach, not object-oriented as is the case when using frameworks like Django and production environments;
The approach was based by default on jupyter notebooks, which are recommended for data science. The notebooks were line by line rewritten into a Python file (PyCharm) and tested.
I believe that the models are not complex enough to create them OOP along with isolated environments.

- Spinodal Method (Octave/Matlab code);
-Acustic Method (Octave/Matlab code);

-The CP-PC-SAFT method (Mathematica script). 

=================================================
Ideas for the future:
-Integration with Docker;
-Creation in Flask of a web application that will return prediction results;
- Throwing in more models, e.g. LightGBM, autoencoders, etc;
-Creating a pipeline that selects the best available model;
